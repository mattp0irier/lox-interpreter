# Lox interpreter in C#
## Matt Poirier and Trevor Russell

This project is for CS 403 Spring 2022. A subset of a Lox interpreter was created in C#. Robert Nystrom's JLox interpreter from his textbook *Crafting Interpreters* was used as a guide to create our interpreter.

## Compilation Instructions - FIX THIS!!!!!!!!
The command used to compile the project is `g++ -std=c++11 lisp-interpreter.cpp -o lisp-interpreter`.

To run in User Input mode:
`./lisp-interpreter`

To run with an input file:
`./lisp-interpreter filename`

---
## Test Cases and Output - FIX THIS!!!!!!!!
Several tests were run on the interpreter in order to verify the interpreter was working. Included test files are:

- simpleStuff: Basic tests of all operations and functions; expected value for each result is printed
- numListOps: A set of operations performed on lists, which demonstrates implicit float to int conversion, defining functions, and several other operations
- pow: Creates a function pow that raises a number to a given power; runs tests with int and float values
- recursionCheck: A simple example demonstrating that recursion works with our interpreter
- numSort: List operations allowing for the creation of the reverse of a list, obtaining the maximum value from a list, and sorting the list in ascending order

The outputs of our tests are stored in the files named `testNameOutput`.
